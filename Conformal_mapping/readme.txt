Run the script, run.bat, to run the project under windows system.

For this project, I choosed the star map for the initial condition. 
For Tuette mapping, I use the steepest gradient method. 
For Harmonic mapping, I use the conjugate gradient method.

The harmonic mapping should be slower than tuette mapping but it is much faster by using conjugate gradient to find the direction.
